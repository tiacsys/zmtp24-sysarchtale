## Required Python version

Currently the repo requires Python 3.11, other versions of python will most likely already fail at installing the dependencies. A simple way to install the desired version of Python is to use *pyenv*

To install the dependencies you also need poetry. The last known version capable to resolve the poetry.lock provided was 1.7.0. You better use this and nothing else.
