Tobias KÃ¤stner designs system and software architectures for medical devices for more than
ten years. In this time he has seen and suffered through a lot of woes and problems,
stemming from decades-old development procedures and ineffective communications within
product development teams. Worse yet, many persistent beliefs about how projects ought to
be run have become completely inappropriate for today's connected and ever faster moving
world. Having followed Zephyr ever since its 1.10 release, the speaker has been using it
in numerous projects collecting a considerable amount of experience to share. In his talk
he will explain what profound impact technologies such as Kconfig or the Device tree have
on the collaboration of hardware and software developers alike. Being also an advocate of
model based systems engineering Tobias will use examples from his real-world projects to
show how system models can inform downstream engineering activities. Thanks to Zephyr's
many clever design decisions, collaboration can be made more effective and the risks of
costly misunderstandings can be significantly reduced. The talk concludes with some ideas
what the future might hold and what still needs to be done for the Zephyr project to
succeed in the medical device and similar industries.
