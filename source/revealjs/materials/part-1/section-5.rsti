.. container:: flex-container

   .. container:: pct65

      .. revealjs-fragments::

         * Can we automatically derive overlays from schematics?

           * Schematics needs annotations, just what exactly?
           * `KiCad's <https://www.kicad.org/>`_ file format is open source and schematics can already be parsed using `kiutils <https://kiutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

         * `SysMLv2 <https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release>`_ is coming

           * Key features: textual DSL to describe models and standardized model query API
           * Create tools to semantically check schematics and devicetree against common system model constraints

Conclusion
==========

.. container:: flex-container

   .. container:: pct65

      * Zephyr's choice of Kconfig and Device Tree allow powerful abstractions for application features and hardware
      * Separation of Concerns and Open/Closed principle very well realized

        * much better product architectures possible

      * Some abstractions still implicit, some technical restrictions apply

      * Checkout the `Bridle Project <https://bridle.tiac-systems.net/doc/latest/bridle/index.html>`_ to dig deeper
